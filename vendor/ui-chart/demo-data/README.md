# Demo Data

This data is used by the components in this plugin when no `data` attribute is bound to the component. In this directory there are both pure data files and also "model" files which leverage the [DummyData](https://github.com/blcook223/DummyData) plugin for Sublime Text and are used to generate the randomly seeded data.
